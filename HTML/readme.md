by [﻿Venkatesan G](https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkatesan-tech/)﻿

# **1. Basic Structure**
The basic structure of any HTML document is as follows:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <!-- Head Section -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Body Section -->
    Your code goes here
</body>
</html>
```
1. `<!DOCTYPE html>` : This is the document type declaration. It informs the web browser that the document is an HTML5 document. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and is widely used for creating web pages.
2. `<html>` : This tag represents the root of the HTML document. All other elements are nested inside this tag.
3. `<head>` : This section contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title of the page, links to external stylesheets or scripts, and other meta tags. It doesn't display any content on the web page itself.
4. `<body>` : This section contains the actual content of the web page, such as text, images, links, and other elements. This is where you put the visible part of your webpage.
5. `<!-- ... -->` : This is an HTML comment. Comments are not displayed on the webpage, but they can be used to provide notes or explanations for the code.
6. `**Your code goes here**` : This is a placeholder for the actual content of your webpage. You would replace this with the HTML elements that make up your webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.
7. Closing tags: Each HTML tag has a corresponding closing tag that begins with a forward slash (`</` ). For example, `<head>`  has a closing tag `</head>` , and `<body>`  has a closing tag `</body>` . Closing tags are used to define the end of a particular section.

# SEMANTIC ELEMENTS

    <a href="/products">Products</a>
    <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```
```

## **META ELEMENT**
The `<meta>` element in HTML is used to provide metadata about the HTML document.

Metadata is information about the document that is not part of the document content but provides additional information for browsers, search engines, and other web services.

Here are some common uses of the `<meta>` element:

**Character Set Declaration:**

Specifies the character encoding for the document. In this example, UTF-8 is a widely used character encoding that supports a broad range of characters.

```
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```
**Viewport Settings for Responsive Design:**

Helps to control the viewport settings, making the web page responsive on various devices by adjusting the width and initial scale.

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
**Page Description for Search Engines:**

Provides a short description of the page content. This can be used by search engines when displaying search results.

```
<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the page content.">
```
**Keywords for Search Engines:**

Specifies a comma-separated list of keywords relevant to the page. Historically, this was used more for search engine optimization (SEO).

```
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web development">
```
**Author Information:**

```html
<meta name="author" content="Author Name">
```
Indicates the author of the document.



# WHAT IS HTML ENTRIES
HTML entities are special codes used to represent reserved characters and symbols in HTML

These codes begin with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`).

## WHAT IS VOID ELEMENT 
- Void elements, also known as self-closing or empty elements
- HTML elements that do not have a closing tag.
Here are some examples of void elements:

1. `<img>` : Represents an image.
```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
```
1. `<br>` : Represents a line break.
```
<p>This is some text.<br>This is on a new line.</p>
```
1. `<hr>` : Represents a thematic break or horizontal line.
```
<p>Some content above<hr>Some content below.</p>
```
1. `<input>` : Represents an input field in a form.
```
<input type="text" name="username" />
```
1. `<meta>` : Provides metadata about the HTML document.
```
<meta charset="UTF-8">
```
These elements are called **"void"** because they don't have content, and their purpose is often to insert something into the document rather than encapsulating content. The self-closing syntax (`<element />`) is equivalent to `<element></element>` but is more concise.
